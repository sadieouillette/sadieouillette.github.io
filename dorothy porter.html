    <h1>Dorothy Porter & the Preservation of Early Black Boston Women Writers’ Texts</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>“[M]any of the rarities of early Afro-Americana are yet to be collected… [but] the extension of N— history deeper into the American past do exist, and in time will be used by those whose task is the re-writing of early N— history,” wrote Dorothy Porter. Porter, a pioneer in library sciences and Black studies, tasked herself with the rewriting of Black history through the collection, preservation, and cataloging of historical Black artifacts. Leading up to her work, Black people did not get a say in what was and was not preserved, meaning that a lot of Black texts, documents, etc. were ‘undiscovered’ in archives or not in archives to begin with. Uncovering these artifacts would help ‘re-write’ Black history by virtue of uncovering more Black thought.</p>
    <h2>Dorothy Porter and Her Work</h2>
   <p>Dorothy Louise Burnett Porter Wesley (1904-1995), more commonly known as Dorothy Porter, was a prolific Black woman librarian and bibliographer who was essential in compiling, cataloging, preserving, and providing access to historical Black literature and writing. She founded the Moorland Spingarn Research Center at Howard University, which is currently the world’s most extensive collection of Black historical artifacts, what Porter called a “literary museum.”</p>
<p>Porter attended Howard University and earned her first bachelor’s degree in 1928, and later earned another at Columbia University in 1931. In 1932, she became the first Black person to receive a master’s degree in Library Service from Columbia University. Back in 1930, she was tasked with curating a collection of Black Americana for Howard University, which she dedicated her life to, eventually becoming the Moorland Spingarn Research Center.
</p>
<p>Well-acquainted with Black artifacts, Porter helped many researchers, scholars, and others interested in knowing more navigate the collections as Black studies took off in the late ‘60s. Non-fictional works like slave narratives were more valued by institutions and collectors, but that didn’t stop Porter from also documenting creative works like poetry and fiction. She also sought to document works by Black women, whose writing got left behind in other archives, taxonomies, and classifications. By going through Howard University archive collections, Porter effectively ‘discovered’ much of Black history. Porter added over 100 more classifications within the Dewey Decimal system number 326 “Slavery, Serfdom, and Emancipation,” which was not suitable to fully organize the texts available about those topics. Over the course of her forty-three-year career at Howard, she collected and cataloged over 175,000 artifacts and compiled numerous collections and bibliographies of Black writing, such as Early N— Writing, 1760-1837, North American N— Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist of Their Writings, 1760-1944, and The N— in the United States; a Selected Bibliography. Porter’s work to preserve, catalog, and provide access to Black writing is massively a reason why we have the brilliant works of many historical Black authors today. She fought for the recognition and respect of Black authors and their writing.</p>
<h2>Authors and Texts Porter Preserved</h2>
<p>Dorothy Porter helped to preserve and provide access to countless historical Black texts, many of which were written by Boston authors. Unlike many scholars, Dorothy Porter, as a Black woman herself, highlighted the work of Black women writers. Here are four Black women writers who all had their work included in at least one of Porter’s books.</p>
<h3>Olivia Ward Bush-Banks (1869-1944)</h3>
<p> Olivia Ward Bush-Banks was a Black, Montauk poet and playwright who lived from 1869 to 1944. Although less well-known, Olivia Ward Bush-Banks was a gifted writer of poetry, plays, and creative non-fiction, referred to as the “grand dame of the literati” by several Black newspapers in the 1900s. Although born in New York, Bush-Banks moved to Boston in the 1890s. While in Boston, she published the collections of poems Original Poems and Driftwood, and also contributed to Boston publications such as the Boston Transcript and the Colored American Magazine, run by the Black woman writer Pauline Hopkins. After 1916, Bush-Banks moved from Boston and lived back and forth between Chicago and New York until her eventual death in New York City in April 1944.</p>
<p>Dorothy Porter included Olivia Ward Bush-Banks’ work in her book North American N— Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist of Their Writings, 1760-1944, which boosted access and knowledge of Bush-Banks’ writing.</p>
<h3>Gertrude P. McBrown (1898-1989)</h3>
<p>Gertrude P. McBrown was a Black poet, playwright, actress, and educator who lived from 1898 to 1989. As a writer of poems and plays, Gertrude P. McBrown was dedicated to encouraging young Black people to be creative. McBrown was born in South Carolina but received much of her education in Boston, beginning at the Curry School of Expression before college. In 1918, she began attending Emerson College, and, after graduating, received a master of education from Boston University. She then taught at Boston Public Schools, and she published several children’s poems in Crisis magazine and the Black Boston publication Saturday Evening Quill. In 1935, she published her first book of poetry, The Picture-Poetry Book. In 1949, she published her first play Bought With Cookies, which was about Frederick Douglass’ early life. In 1953 she published her second play The Birthday Surprise, which was about Paul Laurence Dunbar, a prolific Black poet. In 1989, McBrown passed away.</p>
<p>Dorothy Porter included Gertrude P. McBrown’s work in her book North American N— Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist of Their Writings, 1760-1944, which helped promote the access and knowledge of McBrown’s writing.</p>
<h3>Dorothy West (1907-1988)</h3>
<p>Dorothy West was a Black writer who lived from 1907 to 1988. Dorothy West was a talented writer of short stories and novels, and she was also an actress. West was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1907. In 1921, when she was fourteen, her first short story was published ​​in the Boston Post, and in 1926, she published her short story “the Typewriter.” She settled in Harlem in 1934. Here, she became the editor of the magazines Challenge and New Challenge, and eventually became a contributor to the New York Daily News in the ‘40s. She wrote her first novel The Living is Easy, published in 1948. In 1995, West published her second book titled The Wedding, which Oprah Winfrey made into a television series in 1998, the same year Dorothy West died in Boston. </p>
<p>Dorothy Porter included Dorothy West’s The Living is Easy in The N— in the United States; a Selected Bibliography, which increased the accessibility and knowledge of West’s work. </p>
<h3>Phyllis Wheatley Peters (1753-1784)</h3>
<p>Phyllis Wheatley Peters was a Black writer and poet who lived from 1753 to 1784. Phyllis Wheatley Peters is the most well-known writer out of this group of four writers. Despite being enslaved, Wheatley Peters learned to read and write from a young age, and ended up writing 145 poems, over twenty letters, and published one poetry book. She was the first Black enslaved person and second woman from the United States who published a book of poetry. At about eight years old in 1761, Wheatley Peters was taken from Africa to America and enslaved in a Boston household. She published her first poem in 1767 at the age of fourteen, and her poem “An Elegiac Poem on the Death of that Celebrated Divine, and Eminent Servent of Jesus Christ, the late Reverand, and Pious George Whitefield” was published in Boston, Newport, and Philadelphia in 1770. She published Poems on Various Subjects, which came out in 1773. Sometime between 1774-1778, Wheatley Peters was freed from enslavement, and she moved around the US until her death in 1784.</p>
<p>Countless of Wheatley Peters’ works, including the elegiac poem for George Whitefield and her book Poems on Various Subjects, are in Dorothy Porter’s Early N— Writing, 1760-1837, North American N— Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist of Their Writings, 1760-1944, and The N— in the United States; a Selected Bibliography, which helped to preserve and provide access to Wheatley Peters’ writing. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dorothy Porter, a Black woman librarian, is a big part of the reason why we have access to the wonderful works of Black authors — like Olivia Ward Bush-Banks, Gertrude P. McBrown, Dorothy West, and Phyllis Wheatley Peters. In order to honor both the legacies and work of Dorothy Porter and the Boston authors featured, it is important that we keep talking about these amazing women and continue to preserve Black writing. </p>
