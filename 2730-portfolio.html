<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
<p>I've coded this website to show some of my writing. Most of what I have here is centered around queer/trans history (or some sort of history) and was originally written for one of my classes.</p>
<p>Because I'm a college student (studying English and women's, gender, and sexuality studies at Northeastern University), most of my writing is done in an academic context, but I am also beginning to write creatively, so hopefully I'll get the courage to share some of that too!</p>
<p>Read some words I've written?</p>
<p>If you dare, you can click on the ❀ icon in the upper left corner to see some of my work :) </p>
